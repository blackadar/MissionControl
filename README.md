# Mission Control

## Network Device Control Framework
Mission Control provides a single access point Telnet server to control arrays of network devices.
Devices may have any number of services available to control, and any number of arguments to these services.
This tool will allow developers to easily abstract and control single devices, and large groups of devices in other applications
without the complications of complex network interactions and lower-level programming.

## Deliverable Items
- Hub Package with hypervisor telnet server
- Spoke Package with client interface
- Demonstration of Functionality with a physical device

## Plan
- Week One and Two: Hypervisor and Telnet Framework (COMPLETE)
- Week Three and Four: Abstract Commands and Client Interface
- Week Five and Six: Spoke Client Code, Physical Device Creation
- Week Seven: Off-Schedule Development and Testing

# Comments
1. I would like to see the breakdown of the description by breaking it down to What? Why? and How?
2. Need to be more specific on the deliverables. E.g., What does Hub Package do? What are the Hub Package features?
3. Adjust the plan to fit in 5 weeks schedule including presentation and wrap-up
