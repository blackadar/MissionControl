# Progress Updates


## Week One (October 29 - November 5)

Our team put a large amount of effort into the project this week, and therefore we are very significantly ahead of schedule.
Due to recently discovered foreseeable time restraints at the end of the semester, we felt it better to use time now and get a head-start on
the project. If more time is available at the end of the semester than had been allocated in the proposal, the modular nature of the project
will allow us to further expand the tasks our devices can perform.
